# Diagonising Diabetic Retinopathy using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to diagnose Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using retinal images. The goal is to automate the classification of DR severity, enabling early detection and targeted treatment.

## Background
Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to vision loss. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing severe outcomes. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze retinal images and classify the severity of DR.

## Features
- Automated classification of Diabetic Retinopathy severity
- High accuracy in image analysis
- User-friendly interface for model deployment

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singhdivyanshdishu/Diagonising-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-CNN.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diagonising-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-CNN
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the model, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
Make sure to have your retinal images ready for analysis. The model will output the classification results based on the input images.
